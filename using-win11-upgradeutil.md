# Using My Windows 11 Upgrade Utility

This upgrade utility will let you install Windows 11 on an unsupported PC.

* Download Windows 11 ISO
* Download [the script.](https://github.com/sammy-lord/win11upgradeutil/blob/main/upgrade.bat)
* Mount the Windows 11 ISO
* Check the mounted drive ISO's leter
* Open the script
* Enter the DRIVE LETTER ONLY, no colon, whitespace, or extra path details!
* Click yes at the admin prompt
* The setup will now be spoofed to be the Server Edition setup, thus bypassing TPM and CPU checks.
  * NOTE: Your Windows 10 edition should be preserved if it's Pro or Home. I have not tested it with Enterprise or Server
  * Although I imagine Enterprise and Server DO NOT work.
